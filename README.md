# VulnMapAI
VulnMapAI combines the power of nmapâ€™s detailed network scanning and the advanced natural language processing capabilities of GPT-4 to generate comprehensive and intelligible vulnerability reports. It aims to facilitate the identification and understanding of security vulnerabilities.

## Features
- **Automated Network Scanning:** Uses Nmap for automated discovery and scanning of systems.
- **Exploit Suggestions:** Offers suggestions for potential exploits based on discovered services and versions.
- **Report Generation:** Creates comprehensive reports based on discovery and suggested exploits.
- **Metasploit Integration:** Integrates with Metasploit for searching and verifying exploits.
- **Multi-Process Scanning:** Leverages multi-process capabilities for efficient network scanning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Metasploit Framework
- Nmap
- Required Python libraries: `httpx`, `pymetasploit3`

OR

- Docker

### Usage
- Clone the project and change directory ```git clone https://github.com/davidalami/VulnMapAI.git && cd ./VulnMapAI```
- Build the image ```DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f build/final_image/Dockerfile -t vulnmapai .```
- Run the image in interactive mode, pass a valid openai API key as an environment variable
```docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash -e "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-.." vulnmapai ```
- Pass target IP addresses to the python script, like ```python main.py 127.0.0.1``` and make yourself a coffee! The results will be saved in the `reports` folder.
See the example report [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/davidalami/VulnMapAI/blob/main/report/vsftpd%202.3.4.html).
#### To run the image against HackTheBox machines:
- Run the image
```commandline
docker run -it \
    -e  OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-.." \
     -v $(pwd):/app \
    --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 \
    --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
    --cap-add SYS_MODULE \
    --device /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun \
    --entrypoint=/bin/bash quantumcrack/vulnmapai-final:latest
```
- Run `tmux`, then `openvpn lab_your_username.ovpn`, then `Ctrl+b` and `d`, you should be back to the main terminal
- Run ```python main.py TRYHACKME_MACHINE_IP```. Happy hacking!
