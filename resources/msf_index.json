The vulnerability is within the \"sreplace\" function\n        within the \"src/support.c\" file.\n\n        The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been\n        discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit\n        this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug\n        since then.\n\n        Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the\n        mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow\n        via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'.\n\n        We were unable to reach the \"sreplace\" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable\n        version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them:\n\n        1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace!\n        2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via\n          the \"pr_display_file\" function!\n        3. stupid '.message' file display bug\n\n        So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit.\n        To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a\n        writeable directory, then do \"CWD <writeable directory>\" to trigger the invocation\n        of sreplace function.\n\n        Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message'\n        file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug.\n\n        The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005.\n      ", "path": "linux/ftp/proftp_sreplace"}, {"name": "FTP JCL Execution", "description": "(Submit JCL to z/OS via FTP and SITE FILE=JES.\n        This exploit requires valid credentials on the target system)", "path": "mainframe/ftp/ftp_jcl_creds"}, {"name": "Morris Worm fingerd Stack Buffer Overflow", "description": "\n        This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in fingerd on 4.3BSD.\n\n        This vulnerability was exploited by the Morris worm in 1988-11-02.\n        Cliff Stoll reports on the worm in the epilogue of The Cuckoo's Egg.\n\n        Currently, only bsd/vax/shell_reverse_tcp is supported.\n      ", "path": "bsd/finger/morris_fingerd_bof"}, {"name": "AIX Calendar Manager Service Daemon (rpc.cmsd) Opcode 21 Buffer Overflow", "description": "\n          This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in opcode 21 handled by\n        rpc.cmsd on AIX.

This module exploits an improper input\n          sanitization in versions 7.01, 7.02, 7.03 and 7.07 to inject command directives\n          into the SNMP configuration file and get remote code execution as root. Note\n          that only version 7.03 needs authentication and no authentication is required\n          for versions 7.01, 7.02 and 7.07.\n\n          First, it sends an HTTP POST request to the `snmp-x.php` page with an `SNMPD`\n          command directives (`extend` + command) passed to the `community` parameter.\n          This payload is then added to `snmpd.conf` by the application. Finally, the\n          module triggers the execution of this command by querying the SNMP server for\n          the correct OID.\n\n          This exploit module has been successfully tested against versions 7.01, 7.02,\n          7.03, and 7.07.\n        ", "path": "freebsd/webapp/spamtitan_unauth_rce"}, {"name": "ProFTPD 1.3.2rc3 - 1.3.3b Telnet IAC Buffer Overflow (FreeBSD)", "description": "\n          This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions of ProFTPD\n        server between versions 1.3.2rc3 and 1.3.3b.
