# VulnMapAI
VulnMapAI combines the power of nmapâ€™s detailed network scanning and the advanced natural language processing capabilities of GPT-4 to generate comprehensive and intelligible vulnerability reports. It aims to facilitate the identification and understanding of security vulnerabilities.

## Features
- **Automated Network Scanning:** Uses Nmap for automated discovery and scanning of systems.
- **Exploit Suggestions:** Offers suggestions for potential exploits based on discovered services and versions.
- **Report Generation:** Creates comprehensive reports based on discovery and suggested exploits.
- **Metasploit Integration:** Integrates with Metasploit for searching and verifying exploits.
- **Multi-Process Scanning:** Leverages multi-process capabilities for efficient network scanning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Metasploit Framework
- Nmap
- Required Python libraries: `httpx`, `pymetasploit3`

OR

- Docker

### Usage
- Clone the project and change directory ```git clone https://github.com/davidalami/VulnMapAI.git && cd ./VulnMapAI```
- Build the image ```docker build -f build/final_image/Dockerfile -t vulnmapai .```
- Run the image in interactive mode, pass a valid openai API key as an environment variable
```docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash -e "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-.." vulnmapai ```
- Pass target IP addresses to the python script, like ```python main.py 127.0.0.1``` and make yourself a coffee! The results will be saved in the `reports` folder.
